        The next generation of website architecture is here. Driven by
        dissatisfaction about mobile site speeds, Google championed the
        progressive web application as the way forward. Good mobile PWAs seem to
        load content instantly, even on poor connections, cutting typical user
        journeys by up to half. Now we are seeing responsive PWAs deliver
        instant web experiences to desktop users too.
